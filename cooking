so this is just to highlight concerns that I need to take into account when I am going to docker this shit

1. The user will be able to clone my github repository (firgure out if this is the best motive, just because some environments on compute canada don't have internet). YES I CAN DO THIS
2. There will be a script that they can run to clone all the pfam databases and get everything in the right space. YES I CAN DO THIS 
3. They can change the time limit and memory and all that within my scripts, i will give them instructions for how to do that. THIS WILL BE LISTED IN SET UP INSTRUCTIONS
4. All of the above will be listed in the setup instructions on the github.

NOTE: In my setup script, under python and R installations, I can just do an if command and install all the libraries needed, easy
